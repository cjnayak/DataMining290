#I'm interested in taking this class because I feel that data mining is a neccessary tool to gather data, and conduct ruobust analysis for any business.  There is a paradigm shift occuring in relation to the way that humans harness data on our activities and I think that in order to be equipped for the modern workforce data mining and knowledge of programming is essential.  On a more personal front, I love statistics and feel that this class will enhance my stats and econometrics skills. I am really excited for the semester!
