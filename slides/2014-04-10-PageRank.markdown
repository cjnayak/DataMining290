# PageRank center:

???

## Web page importance

  + Also used to model importance of people, places... anything that has a
    reputation
  + inbound links are important, but scaled by the importance of the source
  + C still important, even though it only has one inbound

---

# Random Walks

  + Starting from a random page, what is the likelihood of winding up on a target
    page?
  + Starting point captured by initial constant
  + Stopping captured by "damping factor" (0.85)
  <img src="img/pagerank.png"/>

???

## Original

  + Original paper did not divide by N
  + This gives relative weights of pages, but not a formal probability because
    sum will not add up to N
  + Either way is fine for our purposes

---

# Example

  + ```B=, =C```, ```D=, all link to =A```
  + =B= has PageRank of 0.5, 4 links
  + =C= has PageRank of 0.7, 4 links
  + =D= has PageRank of 0.2, 1 link

???

## Calculations

  + 0.15 + 0.85 * sum(PR/links for (pr,links) in pages)
  + 0.15 + 0.85 * sum(0.5/4, 0.7/4, 0.2/1)
  + 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.465
  + 0.554525
  + From _Programming Collective Intelligence_

---

# Other Pages

  + But how did we know the PageRank of other pages?
  + Similar to SimRank, we calculate iteratively until convergence

---

# Representing Graphs

  + Adjacency Matrix: Represent graph edges in a matrix

  | V | A | B | C | D |
  | A | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | B | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | C | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  | D | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

???

## Diversion

  + Take a step back so we can motivate how to express these calculations as
    linear algebra
  + Using linear algebra can help us translate graph concepts to fairly elegant
    code, as well as realize some optimizations
  + Draw
  + Symmetric? When?

---

# Representing Graphs

  + Adjacency List: For a vertex, list all connections

```csv
A []
B [A,C]
C [A,D]
D [A,B]
```

???

## Diversion

  + You can think of this as keys (vertex) and values (list of vertices)
  + When would thinking in key-values be useful? MapReduce
  + Back to matrix representation

---

# Eigenvector

  + PageRank formula divides by number of links
  + Modify adjacency matrix typically also normalized such that all rows sum to 1
  + PageRank scores are entries in the largest eigenvector of the matrix
    representation
  <img src="img/pagerank-eigen.png"/>

---

# Eigenvector centrality

  + Another measurement for graphs, using the simple adjacency matrix
  + Relative influence of a node (no normalization)

---

# Adversarial

  + Source does not want to be discovered
  + Patterns are purposefully hidden: so discover the patterns of hiding
  + If adversary knows your techniques, they can take advantage of weakness

???

## Weakness

  + Reading: paper discovering hiding patterns
  + Weakness of pagerank?
  + We assume that these links are legitimate.
  + What happens if the links are not conveying authority?

---

# Google Bomb center

  + Milder forms of adversarial work

???

## Link farms

  + Link farms try to create fake links to pages,
  + [JC Penny's link farm](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/business/13search.html?pagewanted=all)

---

# Hubs & Authorities two_col:

  + Earlier in the web, more structure
  + Hubs: collected links to different resources
  + Authorities: Gave out specific information
  + Score separately?
<img src="img/early-yahoo.jpg"/>

???

## Alternatives

  + Some other interesting network analysis tools

---

# HITS

  + Authority score: sum(hub(i) for i in inbound\_links)
  + Hub score: sum(authority(i) for i in outbound\_links)
  + Normalize: to ensure convergence, square root sum of squares of scores

???

## Iterative

  + Sill iterative, but now using inbound and outbound links to judge
  + Hubs have outbound links to authoritive pages
  + Authorities have inbound links from good hubs

---

# Connections

  + Connected: there exists a path from one vertex to another
  + Connectivity: minimum number of vertices to remove to disconnect remaining
    vertices
  + Clustering Coefficient: Measure of how connected a vertex or group of
    vertices are

???

## Robustness

  + This is used to understand robustness of a system: if an earthquake
    damaged the Bay Bridge, could we still travel from one point to another?
  + What is the connectedness of Oakland and SF?
  + Closely related to min-cuts, which is discussed in the book
  + Network topology: what happens if a router fails?

---

# Clustering Coefficient animate:

  + How many directed edges are possible between 3 vertices?
  + 4 vertices?
  + ```v*(v-1)```
  + Undirected?
  + ```v*(v-1)/2```
  + Clustering Coefficient: Ratio of actual edges to possible edges

???

## Reading

  + Used in Reading this week
  + ```v*(v-1)``` connection to every other node but yourself
  + ```/2``` undirected, don't double count connections

---

## Example

  <img src="img/Directed_acyclic_graph.png"/>

  Connectivity Coefficient of 1; 4

???

### Answer

  + Neighbors of 1: 5 2
  + 2*(2-1) / 2 = 1
  + Actual links = 1
  + Neighbors of 4: 3,5,6
  + 3*(3-1) / 2 = 3
  + Actual: 0
  + If 3-5 connected? 1/3
