  + Midterm should not be cram-and-forget
  + Correct the mistakes on your midterms
  + Ask questions for problems you don't understand

---

# Deliverable

  + GitHub pull request:
  + Question # : Correct answer
  + Open book, notes, everything. Cite sources
  + Have slightly more exposition than the midterm requires

???

## Exposition

  + Eg. if the midterm asks 2 sentences, maybe write 3-4
  + If midterm asks for psudo code, consider writing Python (though syntax will
    not be graded)

---

# Why?

  + These questions frequently come up on interviews, conversation.
  + "How can you describe a distribution?"
  + "Write out a MapReduce job to calculate click through rates."
  + "How can we tell if a review is duplicated?"
